## Checklist

### Required Files
- [ ] ZIP file name follows format: `{appName}-v{version}.zip`
- [ ] ZIP contains single root folder: `commerce-{appName}-app-v{version}/`
- [ ] `manifest.json` includes all required fields (name, displayName, domain, description, version, zip, sha256)
- [ ] `catalog.json` included for new apps only (with INIT values)
- [ ] If updating existing app: Did NOT add new versions to `catalog.json` (CI handles this)
- [ ] If deprecating a version: Added `"deprecated": true` to existing version in `catalog.json`

### Version and Hash Validation
- [ ] `version` in `manifest.json` matches `version` in `commerce-app.json`
- [ ] `zip` field in `manifest.json` matches actual ZIP filename
- [ ] `sha256` in `manifest.json` matches computed hash of ZIP file
- [ ] SHA256 hash verified with: `shasum -a 256 [path-to-zip]`

### ZIP Content Validation
- [ ] No junk files (`.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX`, `Thumbs.db`, hidden files)
- [ ] No registry path prefixes in ZIP (no `tax/`, `domain/`, etc.)
- [ ] All required files present (commerce-app.json, README.md, tasksList.json, services.xml)
- [ ] All referenced scripts/files exist
- [ ] No absolute paths in code
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials

### Icons (Optional but Recommended)
- [ ] Icon included in `icons/` directory at CAP root (if applicable)
- [ ] Icon named `{isv-name}.{ext}` (e.g., `avalara.png`)
- [ ] Icon format is PNG, SVG, JPG, or JPEG
- [ ] Icon validated (CI will check for icon changes and warn if different from existing)

### Directory Structure
- [ ] App follows structure: `{domain}/{isv-name}/`
- [ ] Only ZIP, manifest.json, and catalog.json are committed
- [ ] No extracted directories (`commerce-*-app-v*/`) committed
- [ ] No system files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) committed

### Validation (if using Claude Code)
- [ ] Ran `/validate-commerce-app` skill
- [ ] Ran `/validate-impex` skill (if app contains impex files)
- [ ] All validation checks passed

### Impex Files (if applicable)
- [ ] Service install file has matching uninstall file
- [ ] Uninstall files use `mode="delete"`
- [ ] All attribute IDs prefixed with app name
- [ ] No hardcoded production credentials in services.xml
