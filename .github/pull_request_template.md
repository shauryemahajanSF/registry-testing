## Checklist

### Required Files
- [ ] ZIP file name follows format: `{appName}-v{version}.zip`
- [ ] ZIP contains single root folder: `commerce-{appName}-app-v{version}/`
- [ ] Root `manifest.json` includes all required fields (id, name, description, iconName, domain, version, zip, sha256)
- [ ] App icon exists in ZIP at `commerce-{appName}-app-v{version}/icons/` (CI extracts automatically)
- [ ] Icon filename in ZIP matches `iconName` field in root manifest
- [ ] Translations added to `commerce-apps-manifest/translations/en-US.json` (minimum requirement)
- [ ] `catalog.json` included for new apps only (with INIT values)
- [ ] If updating existing app: Did NOT add new versions to `catalog.json` (CI handles this)
- [ ] If deprecating a version: Added `"deprecated": true` to existing version in `catalog.json`

### Version and Hash Validation
- [ ] `version` in `manifest.json` matches `version` in `commerce-app.json`
- [ ] `zip` field in `manifest.json` matches actual ZIP filename
- [ ] `sha256` in `manifest.json` matches computed hash of ZIP file
- [ ] SHA256 hash verified with: `shasum -a 256 [path-to-zip]`

### ZIP Content Validation
- [ ] No junk files (`.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX`, `Thumbs.db`, hidden files)
- [ ] No registry path prefixes in ZIP (no `tax/`, `domain/`, etc.)
- [ ] Required files present: `commerce-app.json`, `README.md`, `app-configuration/tasksList.json`
- [ ] All referenced scripts/files exist
- [ ] No absolute paths in code
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials

### Directory Structure
- [ ] App located at `{domain}/{appName}/` where `{appName}` matches the "id" field in manifest
- [ ] Only ZIP, root manifest.json, translations, and catalog.json (new apps) are committed
- [ ] No extracted directories (`commerce-*-app-v*/`) committed
- [ ] No system files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) committed

### Validation (if using Claude Code)
- [ ] Ran `/validate-app` skill
- [ ] Ran `/validate-impex` skill (if app contains impex files)
- [ ] Architecture-specific validations passed

### Impex Files (if applicable)
- [ ] Service install file has matching uninstall file
- [ ] Uninstall files use `mode="delete"`
- [ ] All attribute IDs prefixed with app name
- [ ] No hardcoded production credentials in services.xml
- [ ] SITEID placeholder used (not actual site ID)
- [ ] XML files are well-formed and valid
