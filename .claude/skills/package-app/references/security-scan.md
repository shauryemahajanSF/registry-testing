# Security Scan Reference

Run before packaging any app to catch security issues early.

## Running the scan

```bash
bash .github/scripts/security-scan.sh <domain>/<appName>/commerce-<appName>-app-v<version>/
```

## Blocking findings (21 checks — exit code 1)

**Must fix before packaging:**
- S1: Dynamic code evaluation constructs — code injection sinks
- S2: Dynamic module loading with concatenation
- S3: Unsafe innerHTML assignment — XSS risk
- S4: Hardcoded secrets (API keys, AWS keys, GitHub PATs, Slack tokens, private keys)
- S5: Hardcoded credentials in impex XML
- S7: Inline Authorization headers — must use service framework
- S8: Additional DOM sinks — outerHTML assignment, document.write, insertAdjacentHTML
- S9: ISML `<isprint>` with `encoding="off"` — template injection
- S10: Secret files in package (.env, .key, .pem, .p12, .pfx, .jks)
- S11: Direct HTTPClient usage — must use service framework
- S13: setTimeout/setInterval in hook scripts — blocking calls
- S14: Unbounded loops (while(true)/for(;;)) without break/return
- S15: Service profiles missing rate-limit-enabled AND circuit-breaker-enabled
- P1: Service profile XML missing timeout-millis
- Q1: Hook scripts referenced in hooks.json that don't exist
- Q2: Hook scripts missing expected function exports
- Q3: Missing error handling (try/catch) in hook scripts
- Q4: Missing uninstall/services.xml or missing mode="delete" (including service ID mismatches)
- Q5: Hardcoded site-id instead of SITEID placeholder
- Q6: Absolute file paths in code
- Q7: Console logging in cartridge code — use dw.system.Logger

## Warning findings (3 checks — review recommended)

**Should fix but non-blocking:**
- S6: Non-cryptographic random number generation (Math.random)
- S12: PII field names in Logger calls (may be false positive — requires context)
- S16: Session object access in hook scripts (dw.system.Session, session.privacy)

## Response to findings

If **blocking** findings are found:
- **Stop packaging** — do not generate ZIP
- Report specific file paths and line numbers
- Help developer fix each issue
- Re-run scan after fixes

If only **warnings** are found:
- Continue with packaging
- Report warnings for developer review
- Suggest fixes but don't block
